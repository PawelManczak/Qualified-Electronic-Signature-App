# Qualified-Electronic-Signature-App

Description:
This project aims to develop a software tool for emulating the qualified electronic signature, including signing documents and basic encryption operations. The application will adhere to the XAdES standard for electronic signatures and utilize RSA and AES algorithms for encryption and decryption.

Features:
- Emulation of a hardware token (pendrive) for storing the private RSA key.
- Encryption of the private RSA key using AES algorithm with user's PIN.
- XML signature file creation according to XAdES standard.
- Verification of signatures by a second user.
- Basic encryption and decryption using RSA keys.
- GUI interface supporting file selection for signing and encryption/decryption.
- Messages for application status indication.
